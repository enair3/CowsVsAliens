# **Welcome to Cows Vs Aliens, an Alt Ctrl Co-Op Arcade Game!**
You are two aliens vacationing Earth together and have discovered the cutest creature you’ve ever laid eyes on: COWS! Sit in and operate our command chair controllers to collect as many cows as you can to maintain your happiness meter, but don’t fall for the decoys! FBI agents, suspicious of extraterrestrial activity, are disguised as cows and are out to get you AND your new beloveds!
